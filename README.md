# Modeling Lending Club Loans.

Project to find high performing loans in P2P lending.

This is [Isaac Carruthers](https://github.com/carrutstick)'s project while a fellow at [The Data Incubator](http://www.thedataincubator.com/).  See the [website here](https://isaac-thedataincubator-project.herokuapp.com/).  The Data Incubator is an intensive six-week fellowship that prepares the best scientists and engineers with advanced degrees to work as data scientists and quants. It identifies fellows who already have the 90% difficult-to-learn skills and equips them with the last 10%: the tools and technology stack that make them self-sufficient, productive contributors.
